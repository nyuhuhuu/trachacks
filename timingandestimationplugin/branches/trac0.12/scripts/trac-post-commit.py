### Changes for the Timing and Estimation plugin
#
# This script is very similar to "trac-post-commit" included with trac
# itself.  This section explains functional changes relative to that
# script, and comments throughout the code explain other differences.
#
## Logging support for debugging this hook
#
## Support for specifying time spent in commit messages.
#
# "Blah refs #12 (1)" will add 1h to the spent time for issue #12
# "Blah refs #12 (spent 1.5)" will add 1h to the spent time for issue #12
#
# As above it is possible to use complicated messages:
#
# "Changed blah and foo to do this or that. Fixes #10 (1) and #12 (2),
# and refs #13 (0.5)."
#
# This will close #10 and #12, and add a note to #13 and also add 1h
# spent time to #10, add 2h spent time to #12 and add 30m spent time
# to #13.
#
# Note that:
#     (spent 2), (sp 2) or simply (2) may be used for spent
#     ' ', ',', '&' or 'and' may be used references

# This Subversion post-commit hook script is meant to interface to the
# Trac (http://www.edgewall.com/products/trac/) issue tracking/wiki/etc 
# system.
# 
# It should be called from the 'post-commit' script in Subversion, such as
# via:
#
# REPOS="$1"
# REV="$2"
# TRAC_ENV="/path/to/tracenv"
#
# /usr/bin/python /usr/local/src/trac/contrib/trac-post-commit-hook \
#  -p "$TRAC_ENV" -r "$REV"
#
# (all the other arguments are now deprecated and not needed anymore)
#
# It searches commit messages for text in the form of:
#   command #1
#   command #1, #2
#   command #1 & #2 
#   command #1 and #2
#
# Instead of the short-hand syntax "#1", "ticket:1" can be used as well, e.g.:
#   command ticket:1
#   command ticket:1, ticket:2
#   command ticket:1 & ticket:2 
#   command ticket:1 and ticket:2
#
# In addition, the ':' character can be omitted and issue or bug can be used
# instead of ticket.
#
# You can have more then one command in a message. The following commands
# are supported. There is more then one spelling for each command, to make
# this as user-friendly as possible.
#
#   close, closed, closes, fix, fixed, fixes
#     The specified issue numbers are closed with the contents of this
#     commit message being added to it. 
#   references, refs, addresses, re, see 
#     The specified issue numbers are left in their current status, but 
#     the contents of this commit message are added to their notes. 
#
# A fairly complicated example of what you can do is with a commit message
# of:
#
#    Changed blah and foo to do this or that. Fixes #10 and #12, and refs #12.
#
# This will close #10 and #12, and add a note to #12.
